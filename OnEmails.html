<h3><span style="color:#27ae60"><strong>This is a guide for students on when and when not to write that email you are
            thinking of sending to your lecturer.</strong></span></h3>

<p><strong>First, if it isn&#39;t already, it must become clear that </strong><span style="color:#27ae60"><strong>not
            all emails need to be sent. </strong></span><strong>So, which emails should be sent? The answer is
        surprisingly simple: An email should be sent only if it is </strong><span
        style="font-size:18px">important</span><strong>. How do you know if it is important? Also, that is simple to
        determine. All we need is some time travel and a bit or imagination.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">Imagine you lived in a time
            before smartphones and computers were invented. That means there were no emails. To contact your lecturer
            you would have had to do a number of cumbersome things. Ask yourself whether you would have done the
            following which would have been required to get your message to your lecturer:</span></span></p>


<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">1. Pulled out a clean sheet of
            paper and a pen and would have written your message neatly on the page. Remember, if you made a mistake you
            would have to rewrite the whole page.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">2. You would have folded your
            neatly handwritten note and put it in an envelope which you sealed.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">3. You would have written your
            lecturer&#39;s work address on the sealed envelope. Remember, you would not have been able to find the
            required address using google.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">4. You then would have walked to
            the nearest post office where your letter would get a stamp you paid for and would then be sent off to your
            lecturer.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font: size 16px;px"><span style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace">If you would have done all those
            things to get a message to your lecturer, then your message is important and you can write an
            email.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>If you were able to conclude that your email is important, do your best to keep the email you finally do send
        under 200 words. </strong></p>
